`aat` is a framework for writing algorithmic trading strategies in python. It is designed to be modular and extensible, and is the core engine powering [AlgoCoin](https://github.com/timkpaine/algo-coin).

It comes with support for live trading across (and between) multiple exchanges, fully integrated backtesting support, slippage and transaction cost modeling, and robust reporting and risk mitigation through manual and programatic algorithm controls.

Like Zipline, the inspiration for this system, `aat` exposes a single strategy class which is utilized for both live trading and backtesting. The strategy class is simple enough to write and test algorithms quickly, but extensible enough to allow for complex slippage and transaction cost modeling, as well as mid- and post- trade analysis.  


# Overview
`aat` is composed of 4 major parts. 

- trading engine
- risk management engine
- execution engine
- backtest engine

## Trading Engine
The trading engine initializes all exchanges and strategies, then martials data, trade requests, and trade responses between the strategy, risk, execution, and exchange objects, while keeping track of high-level statistics on the system

## Risk Management Engine
The risk management engine enforces trading limits, making sure that stategies are limited to certain risk profiles. It can modify or remove trade requests prior to execution depending on user preferences and outstanding positions and orders.

## Execution engine
The execution engine is a simple passthrough to the underlying exchanges. It provides a unified interface for creating various types of orders.

## Backtest engine
The backtest engine provides the ability to run the same stragegy offline against historical data.

# Trading Strategy
The core element of `aat` is the trading strategy interface. It includes both data processing and order management functionality. Users subclass this class in order to implement their strategies

## Class
```python3
class Strategy(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    @abstractmethod
    def onTrade(self, event: Event):
        '''Called whenever a `Trade` event is received'''

    def onOpen(self, event: Event):
        '''Called whenever an Order `Open` event is received'''

    def onFill(self, event: Event):
        '''Called whenever an Order `Fill` event is received'''

    def onCancel(self, event: Event):
        '''Called whenever an Order `Cancel` event is received'''

    def onChange(self, event: Event):
        '''Called whenever an Order `Change` event is received'''

    def onError(self, event: Event):
        '''Called whenever an internal error occurs'''

    def onStart(self):
        '''Called once at engine initialization time'''
        pass

    def onExit(self):
        '''Called once at engine exit time'''
        pass

    def onHalt(self, data):
        '''Called whenever an exchange `Halt` event is received, i.e. an event to stop trading'''
        pass

    def onContinue(self, data):
        '''Called whenever an exchange `Continue` event is received, i.e. an event to continue trading'''
        pass

    def onAnalyze(self, engine):
        '''Called once after engine exit to analyze the results of a backtest'''
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def requestBuy(self,
                   callback: Callback,
                   data: MarketData):
        '''requestBuy'''

    @abstractmethod
    def requestSell(self,
                    callback: Callback,
                    data: MarketData):
        '''requestSell'''
```

## Example Strategy
Here is a simple trading strategy that buys once and holds. 

```python3
from aat.strategy import TradingStrategy
from aat.structs import MarketData, TradeRequest, TradeResponse
from aat.enums import Side, OrderType
from aat.logging import STRAT as slog, ERROR as elog

class BuyAndHoldStrategy(TradingStrategy):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super(BuyAndHoldStrategy, self).__init__()
        self.bought = None

    def onFill(self, res: TradeResponse) -> None:
        self.bought = res
        log.info('d->g:bought %.2f @ %.2f' % (res.volume, res.price))

    def onTrade(self, data: MarketData) -> bool:
        if self.bought is None:
            req = TradeRequest(side=Side.BUY,
                               volume=1,
                               instrument=data.instrument,
                               order_type=OrderType.MARKET,
                               exchange=data.exchange,
                               price=data.price,
                               time=data.time)
            log.info("requesting buy : %s", req)
            self.requestBuy(req)
            self.bought = 'pending'
    def onError(self, e) -> None:
        elog.critical(e)

    def onChange(self, data: MarketData) -> None:
        pass

    def onCancel(self, data: MarketData) -> None:
        pass

    def onOpen(self, data: MarketData) -> None:
        pass
```

Trading strategies have only one required method handling messages:

- onTrade: Called when a trade occurs

There are other optional callbacks for more granular processing:
- onOpen: Called when a new order occurs
- onFill: Called when a strategy's trade executes
- onCancel: Called when an order is cancelled
- onChange: Called when an order is modified
- onError: Called when a system error occurs
- onHalt: Called when trading is halted
- onContinue: Called when trading continues
- onStart: Called when the program starts
- onExit: Called when the program shuts down

There are also several optional callbacks for backtesting:

- slippage
- transactionCost
- onAnalyze
    - called after trading engine has processed all data, used to visualize algorithm performance

## Setting up and running
An instance of `TradingStrategy` class is able to run live or against a set of historical trade/quote data. When instantiating a `TradingEngine` object, you can set a `type` attribute to be one of:

- `live` - live trading against the exchange
- `simulation` - live trading against the exchange, but with order entry disabled
- `sandbox` - live trading against the exchange's sandbox instance
- `backtest` - offline trading against historical OHLCV data

To test our strategy in any mode, we will need to setup exchange keys to get historical data, stream market data, and make new orders.

### API Keys
You should creat API keys for exchanges you wish to trade on. For this example, we will assume a Coinbase Pro account with trading enabled. I usually put my keys in a set of shell scripts that are gitignored, so I don't post anything by accident. My scripts look something like:

```bash
export COINBASE_API_KEY=...
export COINBASE_API_SECRET=...
export COINBASE_API_PASS=...
```

Prior to running, I source the keys I need. 

### Sandboxes
Currently only the Gemini sandbox is supported, the other exchanges have discontinued theirs. To run in sandbox, set `TradingEngine.type` to Sandbox.

### Live Trading
When you want to run live, set `TradingEngine.type` to Live. You will want to become familiar with the risk and execution engines, as these control things like max drawdown, max risk accrual, execution eagerness, etc.

### Simulation Trading
When you want to run an algorithm live, but don't yet trust that it can make money, set `TradingEngine.type` to simulation. This will let it run against real money, but disallow order entry. You can then set things like slippage and transaction costs as you would in a backtest.

### Testing
Because there are a variety of options, a config file is generally the most usable interface for configuration. Here is an example configuration for backtesting the Buy-and-hold strategy above on CoinbasePro:

```bash
> cat backtest.cfg
[general]
verbose=1
print=0
TradingType=backtest

[exchange]
exchanges=coinbase
currency_pairs=BTC/USD

[strategy]
strategies =
    aat.strategies.buy_and_hold.BuyAndHoldStrategy

[risk]
max_drawdown = 100.0
max_risk = 100.0
total_funds = 10.0
```

### Analyzing an algorithm
We can run the above config by running:
```bash
python3 -m aat ./backtest.cfg
```

We should see the following output:
```bash

```

This will call our `onAnalyze` function, which in this case is implemented to plot some performance characteristics with `matplotlib`.

```python3
        import pandas
        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import seaborn as sns
        matplotlib.rc('font', **{'size': 5})

        # extract data from trading engine
        portfolio_value = engine.portfolio_value()
        requests = engine.query().query_tradereqs()
        responses = engine.query().query_traderesps()
        trades = pandas.DataFrame([{'time': x.time, 'price': x.price} for x in engine.query().query_trades(instrument=requests[0].instrument, page=None)])
        trades.set_index(['time'], inplace=True)

        # format into pandas
        pd = pandas.DataFrame(portfolio_value, columns=['time', 'value', 'pnl'])
        pd.set_index(['time'], inplace=True)

        ax3.plot([x.time for x in requests if x.side == Side.SELL],

                 '1', color='y')
        ax3.plot([x.time for x in responses if x.side == Side.BUY],  # FIXME

We can see that our algorithm also implemented `slippage` and `transactionCost`, resulting in a worse execution price:

```python3
    def slippage(self, resp: TradeResponse) -> TradeResponse:
        slippage = resp.price * .0001  # .01% price impact
        if resp.side == Side.BUY:
            # price moves against (up)
            resp.slippage = slippage
            resp.price += slippage
        else:
            # price moves against (down)
            resp.slippage = -slippage
            resp.price -= slippage
        return resp

    def transactionCost(self, resp: TradeResponse) -> TradeResponse:
        txncost = resp.price * resp.volume * .0025  # gdax is 0.0025 max fee
        if resp.side == Side.BUY:
            # price moves against (up)
            resp.transaction_cost = txncost
            resp.price += txncost
        else:
            # price moves against (down)
            resp.transaction_cost = -txncost
            resp.price -= txncost
        return resp
```

## Extending
Apart from writing new strategies, this library can be extended by adding new exchanges. These are pretty simple. For cryptocurrency exchanges, I rely heavily on `ccxt`, `asyncio`, and websocket libraries.

### Example
Here is the coinbase exchange. Most of the code is to manage different websocket subscription options, and to convert between `aat`, `ccxt` and exchange-specific formatting of things like symbols, order types, etc. 
```python3
class CoinbaseExchange(Exchange):
```

### Orderbook
We implement a full limit-order book, supporting the following order types:

#### Market
Executes the entire volume. If price specified, will execute (price*volume) worth (e.g. relies on total price, not volume)

#### Limit:
Either puts the order on the book,  or crosses spread triggering a trade. By default puts remainder of unexecuted volume on book.

#### Stop-Market
When trade prices cross the target price, triggers a market order.

#### Stop-Limit
When trade prices cross the target price, triggers a limit order.

#### Flags
We support a number of order flags for Market and Limit orders:

- No Flag: default behavior for the given order type
- Fill-Or-Kill:
    - Market Order: entire order must fill against current book, otherwise nothing fills
    - Limit Order: entire order must fill against current book, otherwise nothing fills and order cancelled
- All-Or-None:
    - Market Order: entire order must fill against 1 order on the book, otherwise nothing fills
    - Limit Order: entire order must fill against 1 order, otherwise nothing filled and order cancelled

- Immediate-Or-Cancel:
    - Market Order: same as fill or kill
    - Limit Order: whenever this order executes, fill whatever fills and cancel remaining
